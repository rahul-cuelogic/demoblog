# demoblog
this is a demo blog

Stack:
Symfony 2.7
Twig as template engine
Doctrine 2.4 as ORM

You can use the composer to install the dependecny for this demo
create following dir under "app/cache" dir and set 777 permission to these dir.
dev
prod
test

These three are cache dir

in dev mode access URL will be:

domain.com/app_dev.php/

it will load the homepage

I have also created a data fixture for default users  and a default blog you can run this fixture once app is deployed.
